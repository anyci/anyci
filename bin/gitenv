#    GITENV_CONFIG: gitenv configuration file. "gitenv.yml" by default.
#    GITENV_ROOT: relative configuration and environment file paths are relative to GITENV_ROOT. "~/.gitenv" by default.
#    PROJECT_REMOTE: name of git remote. "origin" by default.
#    PROJECT_ROOT: path to project. current directy by default.
